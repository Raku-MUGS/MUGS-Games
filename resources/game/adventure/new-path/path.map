From here it is 3 day's travel westward to the Duke's Castle, or about an hour
eastward to the nearest village.  An unmarked path leads into the forest on the
north side of the road.

Westward to the Duke's castle is another adventure entirely.  Perhaps you'd
like to head back east?

A sign on the gates reads "Out to lunch, come back later".

As you follow the path into the forest, you become certain that it has not been
trodden by two-legged creatures in some time -- there are no foot or boot prints
and the trail is nearly lost at times as branches and brush have encroached upon
it.  There seem to be quite a few animals using it, however; hoof and paw prints
abound.

| Door

This small, sunlit, roughly circular clearing in the forest sports soft green
grass, wildflowers feeding quietly buzzing bees, and a low mound (perhaps 3 to 4
feet high) near the center.  On the north side of the mound is a gently sloping
path cut into the soil, leading to a wooden door -- clearly quite old, but also
seeming quite sturdy.  Grass has grown onto the path and it appears that
nothing larger than a squirrel has walked on it in ages.
