Where dwell the Ravens,
Beneath the Great Stones of Eld,
In a fortress of Shadows,
The first Guardian is held.

Astride a Serpentine path,
Along a Road born of tears,
The Quiet One's wrath
Feeds the Second's worst fears.

The Glow of crimson Blaze,
The Dance of brilliant Storm,
The Strike of ringing Steel,
And the Third has taken Form.

Generations pass as the Guardians sleep,
And Artificers strain for the Promises they keep;
In the Mages' crystal keys, 'neath Barriers deep
Lie the Powers of ages, that the Wicked may weep.
