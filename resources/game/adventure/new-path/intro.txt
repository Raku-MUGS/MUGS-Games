You are on the road to town, a road you have walked a hundred times.  It is a
road that bores you immensely, a road where your mind wanders to the climactic
moments of your last grand adventure.  As your mind wanders so does your gaze,
seeking out any new detail on which your imagination may alight ....

There is a path leading off the road here, a path you can't recall noticing
before.  Neither beckoning nor foreboding, it simply is.  You stop and
consider: the road well traveled, a chance to pick up supplies you have run
short of; or the path newly found, leading to places and adventures unknown?
