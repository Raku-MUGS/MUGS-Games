Light reveals a simple circular chamber, perhaps 30 feet across, with a sloped
ceiling that roughly mirrors the shape of the mound above.  The sloping path
from the wooden doorway continues 10 feet further into the room, leaving the
floor low enough to stand upright comfortably.

There are four dark passageways leading northeast, northwest, southeast, and
southwest.  Above the passage entrances are pictures of a flame, a scroll, an
axe, and a spiral, respectively.

On a small wooden table lies an old parchment which reads:

    One leads to mystery,
    One leads to pain,
    One leads to tragedy,
    One leads to gain.
